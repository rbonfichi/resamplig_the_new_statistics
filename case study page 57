# Case study page 57

# What are the chances of the Skins winning their first two games if we think 
# that each of those games can be modeled by our urn containing six red and 
# four green balls?

# This code simulates drawing two balls with replacement a thousand times and 
# then gives you the proportion of times both balls were green ("Win"). 
# This proportion is an estimate of the probability that you seek.

set.seed(123)  # Setting a seed for reproducibility

# Step 1: Set up the urn with balls
urn <- c(rep("Win", 6), rep("Lose", 4)) # rep("Win", 6) creates a vector of six "Win" strings:
                                        # rep("Lose", 4) creates a vector of four "Lose" strings
                                        # and c(...) combines these two vectors into a single vector.

n_simulations <- 1000
yes_count <- 0

# Start the simulation loop
for (i in 1:n_simulations) {
  # Step 2: Draw the first ball and replace it
  first_draw <- sample(urn, 1)
  
  # Step 3: Draw the second ball 
  second_draw <- sample(urn, 1)
  
  # Step 4: Check if both drawn balls were green ("Win") 
  if (first_draw == "Win" && second_draw == "Win") {
    yes_count <- yes_count + 1
  }
}

# Step 6: Calculate the proportion of “Yes” 
probability <- yes_count / n_simulations
