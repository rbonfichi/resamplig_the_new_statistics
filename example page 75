# SUM OF PROBABILITY

# Put 7 blue balls (nice day), 1 black ball (snowy day) and 2 gray balls (rainy 
# day) into an urn. 
# You want to know the probability of a blue or a gray ball. 
# To find this probability:
# 1. Draw one ball and record “yes” if its color is blue or gray,“no” otherwise
# 2. Repeat step 1 perhaps 200 times.
# 3. Find the proportion of “yes” trials.


set.seed(123)  # Setting a seed for reproducibility

# Define the urn with the balls
urn <- c(rep("blue", 7), "black", rep("gray", 2))

n_trials <- 200  # Number of trials
yes_count <- 0  # To count the number of times a blue or gray ball is drawn

# Conduct the simulation
for (i in 1:n_trials) {
  drawn_ball <- sample(urn, 1)  # Draw one ball
  
  # Check if the drawn ball is blue or gray
  if (drawn_ball %in% c("blue", "gray")) {
    yes_count <- yes_count + 1
  }
}

# Calculate the proportion of “yes” trials
probability <- yes_count / n_trials
print(probability)
