# A puzzle from Gardner: 
# Shuffle a packet of four cards—two red, two black—and deal them face down in
# a row. Two cards are picked at random, say by placing a penny on each. 
# What is the probability that those two cards are the same color?



set.seed(123)  # Setting a seed for reproducibility

n_simulations <- 100000  # Number of simulations
success_count <- 0  # To count the number of times two cards of the same color are picked

for (i in 1:n_simulations) {
  cards <- c("R", "R", "B", "B")  # Two reds and two blacks
  sampled_cards <- sample(cards, 2, replace = FALSE)  # Sample two cards without replacement
  
  # Check if the two sampled cards are of the same color
  if (sampled_cards[1] == sampled_cards[2]) {
    success_count <- success_count + 1
  }
}

probability <- success_count / n_simulations
print(probability)
