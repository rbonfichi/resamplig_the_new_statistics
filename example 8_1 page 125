# What is the Probability of selecting four girls and one boy when selecting five
# students from any twenty-five girls andtTwenty-five Boys? 
# It is a sampling without replacement when there are two outcomes and the 
# order does not matter.

# Combinatorial Approach:
# The probability can be calculated by taking the combination of selecting 4 girls
# out of 25 and 1 boy out of 25, divided by the combination of selecting any 5 
# students out of 50.

# Using choose() function to calculate combinations
P <- (choose(25,4) * choose(25,1)) / choose(50,5)
P


# Simulation Approach:
# Simulate the selection process many times and estimate the probability by 
# calculating the proportion of times we select 4 girls and 1 boy.

set.seed(123)  # Setting a seed for reproducibility
